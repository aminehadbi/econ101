\title{Constrained optimization}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Today's lecture is about constrained optimization. Many economic
models involve a constrained estimation problem. For example, a
consumer choosing goods $x$, labor $l$, and leisure $\ell$ faces a
problem of the form:
Most optimization
problems in economics 
\begin{align*} 
  \max u(x,l,\ell) \text{ s.t. } & px \leq wl \\
  & l + \ell \leq 24.
\end{align*}
We will see many other examples of constrained optimization problems. 

\section{First order conditions}

\subsection{Equality constraints}
To begin our study of constrained optimization, let's look at a
maximization problem with equality constraints. 
\[ \max f(x) \text{ s.t. } h(x) = c \]
where $f: \R^n \to \R$ and $h: \R^n \to \R^m$. You have probably
analyzed such a problem graphically when $n=2$ and $m=1$. You draw the
constraint set and the level curves of the objective function. The
maximum occurs where the level curves are tangent to the
constraint. There's a nice picture and discussion of this in chapter
18.2 of Simon and Blume.  At the point of tangency, the slopes of the
level curve and the constraint are equal. By the implicit function
theorem, these slopes are $-\frac{(\partial f)/(\partial x_1)}
{(\partial f)/(\partial x_2)}$ and$-\frac{(\partial h)/(\partial x_1)}
{(\partial h)/(\partial x_2)}$. These slopes are equal at the
maximizer $x^*$, so
\begin{align*}
  \frac{(\partial f)/(\partial x_1) (x^*)}
  {(\partial f)/(\partial x_2)(x^*)} = & \frac{(\partial h)/(\partial x_1)(x^*)}
  {(\partial h)/(\partial x_2)(x^*)} \\
  \frac{(\partial f)/(\partial x_1)(x^*)}
  {(\partial h)/(\partial x_1)(x^*)} = & \frac{(\partial f)/(\partial x_2)(x^*)}
  {(\partial h)/(\partial x_2)(x^*)} \equiv \mu
\end{align*}
where $\mu$ is defined by the above equality. We can then rewrite the
equation as
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} (x^*) - \mu \frac{\partial
    h}{\partial x_1}(x^*) = & 0 \label{ef1} \\
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} (x^*) - \mu \frac{\partial
    h}{\partial x_2}(x^*) = & 0 \label{ef2}
\end{align}
We also know that 
\begin{align}
  h(x^*) - c = 0\label{ebc}
\end{align}
(\ref{ef1}), (\ref{ef2}), and(\ref{ebc}) give us three equations in
three unknowns ($x_1*, x_2^*, \mu$).  Note that these three equations
are the first order conditions for maximizing 
\[ L(x,\mu) \equiv f(x) - \mu(h(x) - c). \]
This function is called the \textbf{Lagrangian}. $\mu$ is called a
\textbf{Lagrange multiplier}. 

The relationship that we just saw for two dimensional functions is
always true. Any local maximizer of a constrained optimization problem is a
critical point of the problem's Lagrangian. 
\begin{theorem}[First order condition for maximization with equality constraints] \label{thm:econ}
  Let $f:U \to \R$ and $h: U \to \R^m$ be continuously
  differentiable on $U \subseteq \R^n$. Suppose $x^* \in
  \mathrm{interior}(U)$ is a local maximizer of $f$ on $U$ subject to 
  $h(x) = c$. Also assume that $Dh_{x^*}$ has rank $m$. Then there
  exists $\mu^* \in \R^m$ such that $(x^*, \mu^*)$ is a critical point
  of the Lagrangian,
  \[ L(x,\mu) = f(x) - \mu^T (h(x) - c). \]
  i.e.
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x^*,\mu^*) = & \frac{\partial
      f}{\partial x_i} - {\mu^*}^T \frac{\partial h}{\partial
      x_i}(x^*) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu_j}(x^*,\mu^*) = & h(x^*) -
    c = 0
  \end{align*}
  for $i = 1, ..., n$ and $j=1,...,m$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
  Consider the $(m+1)$ system of nonlinear equations
  \begin{align*}
  f(x) - f_0 & = 0 \\
  h(x) - c &=0.
  \end{align*}
  We know that $x^*$ satisfies this system of equations with $f_0 = f(x^*)$.
  By the implicit function theorem, if the $(m+1) \times n$ 
  matrix 
  \begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix} Df_{x^*} \\ Dh_{x^*} \end{pmatrix} \label{drank}
  \end{align}
  has full rank then we could write the first $\min\{m+1,n\}$
  components of $x$ as a function the other components of $x$, $f_0$,
  and $c$ in some neighborhood of $x^*$. But then there is some
  $\epsilon > 0$ and $x'$ in this neighborhood of $x^*$ such that 
  \begin{align*}
    f(x') = & f_0 + \epsilon  \\
    h(x)' = & c
  \end{align*}
  which contradicts $x^*$ being a local maximum. Therefore, the rank
  (\ref{drank}) must be less than $m+1$. Thus, the rows of that matrix
  are linearly dependent, so there exists $\alpha_j$ not all zero such that 
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_0 Df_{x^*} + \alpha_1 D{h_1}_{x^*}  + \cdots + \alpha_m
    D{h_n}_{x^*} = 0      
  \end{align*}
  Moreover it must be that $\alpha0 \neq 0$ because otherwise
  $Dh_{x^*}$ would be singular. Setting $\mu_j = \alpha_j/\alpha_0$
  gives the conclusion of the theorem.
\end{proof}
The assumption that $Dh_{x*}$ is non-singular is needed to make sure
that we don't divide by zero when defining the Lagrange
multipliers. This assumption is called the \textbf{non-degenerate
  constraint qualification}. 

\subsection{Inequality constraints}

Now let's consider an inequality instead of equality constraint. 
\[ \max_{x \in U} f(x) \text{ s.t. } g(x) \leq b. \]
When the constraint binds, i.e.\ $g(x^*) = b$, the situation is
exactly the same as with an equality constraint. However, the
constraint does not necessarily bind at a local maximum, so we must allow
for that possibility.  Let $\lambda$ be the Lagrange multiplier for
the above problem. If the constraint binds, then
\[ Df_{x^*} - \lambda D g_{x^*} = 0. \]
Also, since $Df_{x^*}$ is the direction in which $f$ increases most
rapidly, it must be that going in that direction would violate the
constraint. That is, for any $\delta > 0$
\begin{align*} 
  g(x^* + \delta Df_{x^*}^T) > & b \\ 
  g(x^*) + \delta Dg_{x^*} Df_{x^*}^T + o(\delta^2) > & b \\
  Dg_{x^*} Df_{x^*}^T > & 0
\end{align*}
The first order condition says that 
\[ Df_{x^*} Df_{x^*}^T =  \lambda D g_{x^*} D f_{x^*}^T \]
$Df_{x^*} Df_{x^*}^T$ is always positive, so it must that when the
constraint binds, $\lambda > 0$. If the constraint does not bind, we
can use the same first order condition with $\lambda=0$. Thus, we have
$\lambda \geq 0$ and equals zero iff $g(x^*) < b$. This situation
where one of two inequalities binds is called a \textbf{complementary
  slackness condition}. 
\begin{theorem}[First order condition for maximization with inequality constraints] \label{thm:icon}
  Let $f:U \to \R$ and $g: U \to \R^m$ be continuously
  differentiable on $U \subseteq \R^n$. Suppose $x^* \in
  \mathrm{interior}(U)$ is a local maximizer of $f$ on $U$ subject to 
  $g(x) \leq b$. Suppose that the first $k \leq m$ constraints, bind
  \[ g_j(x^*) = b_j \]
  for $j = 1 ... k$ and that the Jacobian for these constraints, 
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} 
    \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_n}  \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_n}  
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  has rank $k$. Then, there exists
  $\lambda^* \in \R^m$ such that for
  \[ L(x,\lambda) = f(x) - \lambda^T (g(x) - b). \]
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & \frac{\partial
      f}{\partial x_i} - {\lambda^*}^T \frac{\partial g}{\partial
      x_i}(x^*) = 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda_j}(x^*,\lambda^*) =
    & \lambda_j^* \left(g(x^*) - c \right)= 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* & \geq 0 \\
    g(x^*) & \leq b
  \end{align*}
  for $i = 1, ..., n$ and $j=1,...,m$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By our theorem for maximization with equality constraints
  (\ref{thm:econ}), there exists $\lambda_1^*, ..., \lambda_k^*$ such
  that   
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & \frac{\partial
      f}{\partial x_i} - {\lambda^*}^T \frac{\partial g}{\partial
      x_i}(x^*) = 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda_j}(x^*,\lambda^*) =
    & \left(g(x^*) - c \right)= 0 \\
  \end{align*}
  we can set $\lambda_{k+1}^*,..., \lambda_m^*$ to zero, and satisfy
  all the equations in the conclusion of the theorem.
  
  All that remains
  is to verify that $\lambda_1^*\geq 0, ..., \lambda_k^* \geq0$ . Let
  $g^k: \R^n \to \R^k$ be the $k$ binding constraints and $b^k$ be
  $(b_1 \cdots b_k)^T$. We know that 
  \[ g^k(x^*) = b^k. \]
  By hypothesis, $Dg^k_{x*}$ has rank $k$. Therefore, we can choose
  $k$ components of $x$ such that
  \[ \begin{pmatrix}    \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_{i1}} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_{ik}}  \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_{i1}} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_{ik}}  
  \end{pmatrix} = D_{x^k}g^k 
  \]
  is invertible. Let $x^k = (x_{i1} \cdots x_{ik})^T $. By the
  implicit function theorem, we can solve for $x^k$ as a function of
  the other components of $x$ and $b$. In particular, we could
  construct a $\chi:[0,\epsilon) \to \R^{n}$ that is continuously
  differentiable such that $\chi(0) = x^*$ and
  \begin{align*}
    g_1(\chi(t)) = & b_1 - t 
  \end{align*}
  and $g_i(\chi(t)) = b_i$ for other $i$. Differentiating,
  \begin{align*}
    {Dg_1}_{x^*} \chi'(0) = & -1  \\
    {Dg_j}_{x^*} \chi'(0) = & 0,
  \end{align*}
  Also, $\chi(t)$ satisfies the constraints, so it cannot increase
  $f(x^*)$, i.e.
  \begin{align*}
    0 \geq & \frac{d}{dt} f(\chi(t)) |_{t=1} \\
    0 \geq & Df_{x^*} \chi'(t)
  \end{align*}
  From the Lagrangian first order condition, we also know that 
  \[ Df_{x^*} - \lambda^k Dg^k_{x^*} = 0 \]
  we can multiply by $\chi'(t)$ to get
  \begin{align*} 
    Df_{x^*}\chi'(t) = & \lambda^k Dg^k_{x^*} \chi'(t) \\
    Df_{x^*} \chi'(t) = & -\lambda_1  \leq 0.
  \end{align*}
  Thus $\lambda_1 \geq 0$. We could redefine $\chi(t)$ using $j=2,
  ..., k$ in place of $1$ to show that the other $\lambda$'s are
  positive as well.  
\end{proof}
In this proof, there is no difference between a binding
inequality constraint and an equality constraint, so we can easily
adapt this theorem to maximization problems with both inequality and
equality constraints.

\begin{theorem}[First order condition for maximization with mixed constraints] \label{thm:mcon}
  Let $f:U \to \R$, $h:U \to \R^l$, and $g: U \to \R^m$ be
  continuously differentiable on $U \subseteq \R^n$. Suppose $x^* \in 
  \mathrm{interior}(U)$ is a local maximizer of $f$ on $U$ subject to 
  $h(x) = c$ and $g(x) \leq b$. Suppose that the first $k \leq m$
  constraints, bind 
  \[ g_j(x^*) = b_j \]
  for $j = 1 ... k$ and that the Jacobian for these constraints along
  with the equality constraints,
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} 
    \frac{\partial h_1}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      h_1}{\partial x_n}  \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      h_l}{\partial x_n}  \\    
    \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_n}  \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      g_k}{\partial x_n}  
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  has rank $k+l$. Then, there exists
  $\mu^* \in \R^l$ and $\lambda^* \in \R^m$ such that for 
  \[ L(x,\lambda,\mu) = f(x) - \lambda^T (g(x) - b) - \mu^T(h(x) - c). \]
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & \frac{\partial
      f}{\partial x_i} - {\lambda^*}^T \frac{\partial g}{\partial
      x_i}(x^*) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu_\ell}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & h_\ell(x^*) - c = 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda_j}(x^*,\lambda^*) =
    & \lambda_j^* \left(g(x^*) - c \right)= 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* & \geq 0 \\
    g(x^*) & \leq b
  \end{align*}
  for $i = 1, ..., n$, $\ell = 1,..., l$, and $j=1,...,m$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Second order conditions}

As with unconstrained optimization, the first order conditions from
the previous section only give a necessary condition for $x^*$ to be a
local maximum of $f(x)$ subject to some constraints. To verify that a
given $x^*$ that solves the first order condition is a local maximum,
we must look at the second order condition. As in the previous
lecture, we can take a second order expansion of $f(x)$ around $x^*$. 
\begin{align*}
  f(x^*+v) - f(x^*) = & Df_{x^*} v + v^T D^2 f_{x^*}
  v + r(v,x^*) \\
  = & v^T D^2 f_{x^*} v + r_f(v,x^*) \\
\end{align*}
This is constrained problem, so any $x^* + v$ must satisfy the
constraints as well. As in the previous section, what will really
matter are the equality constraints and binding inequality
constraints. To simplify notation, let's just work with equality
constraints, say $h(x)=c$. We can take a first order expansion of $h$
around $x^*$ to get
\[ h(x^* + v) = h(x^*) + Dh_{x*} v + r_h(v,x^*) = c. \]
When $v$ is small, we can show that $r_h(v,x^*)$ can be
ignored. Then $v$ satisfies the constraints if
\begin{align*}
  h(x^*) + Dh_{x^*} v = & c \\
  Dh_{x^*} v = & 0
\end{align*}
Thus, $x^*$ is a local maximizer of $f$ subject to $h(x) = c$ if
\[ v^T D^2 f_{x^*} v \leq 0 \] for all $v$ such that that $Dh_{x^*} v
= 0$. The following theorem precisely states the result of this
discussion.
\begin{theorem}[Second order condition for constrained maximization]
  Let $f:U \to \R$ be twice continuously
  differentiable on $U$, and $h:U \to \R^l$ and $g: U \to \R^m$ be
  continuously differentiable on $U \subseteq \R^n$. Suppose $x^* \in    
  \mathrm{interior}(U)$ and there exists
  $\mu^* \in \R^l$ and $\lambda^* \in \R^m$ such that for 
  \[ L(x,\lambda,\mu) = f(x) - \lambda^T (g(x) - b) - \mu^T(h(x) - c). \]
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & \frac{\partial
      f}{\partial x_i} - {\lambda^*}^T \frac{\partial g}{\partial
      x_i}(x^*) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu_\ell}(x^*,\lambda^*) = & h_\ell(x^*) - c = 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda_j}(x^*,\lambda^*) =
    & \lambda_j^* \left(g(x^*) - c \right)= 0 \\
    \lambda_j^* & \geq 0 \\
    g(x^*) & \leq b
  \end{align*}
  Let $B$ be the matrix of the derivatives of the binding constraints
  evaluated at $x^*$,
  \[ B = \begin{pmatrix} 
    \frac{\partial h_1}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      h_1}{\partial x_n}  \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      h_l}{\partial x_n}  \\    
    \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      g_1}{\partial x_n}  \\ 
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_1} &  \cdots &\frac{\partial
      g_k}{\partial x_n}  
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  If 
  \[ v^T D^2 f_{x*} v < 0 \]
  for all $v \neq 0$ such that $B v = 0$, then $x^*$ is a strict
  local constrained maximizer for $f$ subject to $h(x) = c$ and $g(x)
  \leq b$. 
\end{theorem}
Recall from the last lecture that an $n$ by $n$ matrix, $A$, is
negative definite if $x^T A x < 0$ for all $x \neq 0$. Similarly, we
say that $A$ is negative definite on the null space of $B$ if $x^T A x
< 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{N}(B) \setminus\{0\}$. Thus, the second
order condition for constrained optimization could be stated as saying
that the Hessian of the objective function must be negative definite
on the null space of the Jacobian of the binding constraints. The
proof is similar to the proof of the second order condition for
unconstrained optimization, so we will omit it. 

\subsection{Definiteness on subspaces}

The second order condition for constrained maximization depends on the
Hessian being negative definite on the null space of the Jacobian of
the constraints. As with simple definiteness, definiteness on
subspaces depends on the determinants or eigenvalues of certain
matrices.
\begin{definition}
  Let $A$ be an $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix and $B$ be $m$ by $n$, then $A$ is 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Negative definite on $\mathcal{N}(B)$} if $x^T A x <
    0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{N}(B) \setminus \{0\}$ 
  \item \textbf{Positive definite on $\mathcal{N}(B)$} if $x^T A x >
    0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{N}(B) \setminus \{0\}$ 
  \item \textbf{Indefinite on $\mathcal{N}(B)$} if $\exists$ $x_1 \in
    \mathcal{N}(B) \setminus \{0\}$  
    s.t. $x_1^T A x_1 > 0$ and 
    some other $x_2 \in \mathcal{N}(B) \setminus \{0\}$  such that
    $x_2^T A x_2 < 0$. 
  \end{itemize}  
\end{definition}
The following theorem gives a condition for a matrix being negative
definite on a subspace in terms of determinants.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:nds}
  Let $A$ be an $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix and $B$ be $m$ by
  $n$. Then $A$ is negative definite iff the last $n-m$ leading principal
  minors of  
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 & B \\
      B & A 
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  alternate in sign, and the final $(n+m)$th principal minor has the
  same sign as $(-1)^n$.
\end{theorem}
Similar results can be stated for positive definite and indefinite
matrices. You can find them in chapter 16 of Simon and Blume.

We can also check for definiteness using eigenvalues. Suppose $B$ is
rank $m$. Then we can arrange $B$ such that its first $m$ columns are
linearly independent. Call this submatrix $B_1$ and the rest of $B$,
$B_2$. So that $B = \begin{pmatrix} B_1 & B_2 \end{pmatrix}$. The
constraint can be written
\begin{align*}
  0 = & B x = \begin{pmatrix} B_1 & B_2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
    x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} \\
  = & B_1 x_1 + B_2 x_2 \\
  x_1 = & -(B_1)^{-1} B_2 x_2
\end{align*}
and the set of $x$ that satisfy the constraint are
\begin{align*} x = & \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} \\
  = & \begin{pmatrix}
    (B_1)^{-1} B_2 x_2 \\ I_{n-m} x_2 \end{pmatrix} \\
  = & \begin{pmatrix}
    (B_1)^{-1} B_2 \\ I_{n-m} \end{pmatrix} x_2
\end{align*}
Then, $x^T A x$ for $x$ satisfying the constraint is
\begin{align*}
  x^T A x = & x_2^T \begin{pmatrix}
    (B_1)^{-1} B_2 \\ I_{n-m} \end{pmatrix}^T \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & A_2
    \\ A_2^T & A_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
    (B_1)^{-1} B_2 \\ I_{n-m} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
where $A_1$ is $m$ by $m$, $A_2$ is $m$ by $n-m$ and $A_3$ is $n-m$ by
$n-m$. Multiplying out,
\begin{align*}
  x^T A x = & x_2^T \left( B_2^T (B_1^T)^{-1} A_1 (B_1)^{-1} B_2 +
    B_2^T (B_1^T)^{-1} A_2 +  A_2^T (B_1)^{-1} B_2 + A_3\right) x_2
\end{align*}
It is easy to verify that the matrix in the middle above is
symmetric. Thus $A$ is negative definite on $\mathcal{N}(B)$ if and
only if $\left(B_2^T (B_1^T)^{-1} A_1 (B_1)^{-1} B_2 +
  B_2^T (B_1^T)^{-1} A_2 +  A_2^T (B_1)^{-1} B_2 + A_3\right)$ is
negative definite on $\R^m$. From last lecture, we know that this
matrix is negative definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are
negative. Note that this is an $n-m$ by $n-m$ matrix, so like there
are $n-m$ eigenvalues, just like there are $n-m$ principal minors to
check in theorem \ref{thm:nds}. 

\section{Multiplier interpretation}

Consider a constrained maximization problem,
\[ \max_{x \in U} f(x) \text{ s.t. } h(x) = c \]
From \ref{thm:econ}, the first order conditions are
\begin{align*}
 Df_{x^*} - \mu^T Dh_{x*} = & 0 \\
 h(x^*) - c = & 0.
\end{align*}
What happens to $x^*$ and $f(x^*)$ if $c$ changes? Let $x^*(c)$ denote
the maximizer as a function of $c$. Differentiating the constraint
with respect to $c$ shows that
\[ Dh_{x^*(c)} Dx^*_c = I \]
By the chain rule,
\[ D_c \left( f(x^*(c)) \right) = Df_{x^*(c)} Dx^*_c. \] 
Using the first order condition to substitute for $Df_{x^*(c)}$, we
have
\begin{align*}
  D_c \left( f(x^*(c)) \right) = & \mu^T Dh_{x^*(c)}Dx^*_c \\
  = & \mu^T 
\end{align*}
Thus, the multiplier, $\mu$, is the derivative of the maximized
function with respect to $c$.  We could have looked at a
problem with inequality constraints and gotten the same
conclusion. The following theorem summarizes this observation.
\begin{theorem}[Multiplier interpretation]\label{thm:muint} 
  Under the conditions of theorem \ref{thm:mcon}, let $x^*(b,c)$
  denote the solution of the constrained maximization problem,
  \begin{align*}
    \max_{x \in U} f(x) \text{ s.t. } & g(x) \leq b \\
    & h(x) = c ,
  \end{align*}
  and let $\mu(b,c)$ and $\lambda(b,c)$ denote the corresponding
  Lagrange multipliers. The for each $j=1..m$,
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial b_j} f(x^*(b,c)) = \lambda_j(b,c) \]
  and for each $j=1,...,l$,
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial c_j} f(x^*(b,c)) = \mu_j(b,c). \]
\end{theorem} 
In economic terms, the multiplier is the
marginal value of increasing the constraint. Because of this 
$\lambda_j$ is often called the shadow price of $b_j$. 

\section{Envelope theorem}

Most of the objective functions that we analyze in economics depend on
some parameters. That is, we often want to maximize $f(x,\alpha)$ with
respect to $x$ where $\alpha$ are some parameters. For example, if $f$ is a
utility function, $\alpha$ could include things like the discount rate and
the coefficient of risk aversion. If $f$ is a production function, say
Cobb-Douglas, $f(x,\alpha) = A \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{a_i}$, then $\alpha
= (A,a_1,...,a_n)$. Envelope theorems tell us how the maximum of
$f(x,\alpha)$ changes with $\alpha$. 

\subsection{Unconstrained problems}

Let $f:U \times A \to \R$ where $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $A
\subseteq \R^k$. Consider
\[ \max_{x \in U} f(x,\alpha). \]
Let $x^*(\alpha)$ be a local maximizer. Using the chain rule,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d }{d \alpha_j} f(x^*(\alpha),\alpha) = & \sum_{i=1}^n
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial x_i^*}{\partial \alpha_j}
  + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \alpha_j } \\
  & = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \alpha_j }(x^*(\alpha),\alpha)
\end{align*}
where the second line follows from the first order condition.


\subsection{Constrained problems}

To save on notation, we will just discuss problems with equality
constraints here, but we could just as well apply the analysis to
binding inequality constraints as well. 
Let $f:U \times A \to \R$ and $h:U \times A \to \R^l$ where $U
\subseteq \R^n$ and $A \subseteq \R^k$. Consider
\[ \max_{x \in U} f(x,\alpha) \text{ s.t. } h(x,\alpha) = 0. \]
Let $x^*(\alpha)$ be a local maximizer, and let
$L(x^*(\alpha),\mu^*(\alpha),\alpha)$ be the Lagrangian. Using the
chain rule, 
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d \alpha_j} L(x^*(\alpha),\mu^*(\alpha),\alpha) = & \sum_{i=1}^n
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial x_i^*}{\partial
    \alpha_j} + \sum_{k=1}^l\frac{\partial L}{\partial
    \mu_k} \frac{\partial \mu_k^*}{\partial 
    \alpha_j}   + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \alpha_j } \\
  = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \alpha_j
  }(x^*(\alpha),\mu^*(\alpha),\alpha) 
\end{align*}
Note that in this section we have been assuming that $x^*(\alpha)$ is
continuously differentiable. Relatedly, in the previous section we
assumed that $x(b,c)$ is continuously differentiable. A sufficient
condition for this can be obtained by applying the implicit function
theorem to the first order condition. The implicit function theorem
requires that the system of equations being consider has a nonsingular
derivative. Here, the system of equations already involve the first
derivative of the Lagrangian, so the derivative of the first order
condition is the Hessian of the Lagrangian. Thus, a sufficient
condition for $x^*(\alpha)$ to be continuously differentiable is that
the Hessian of the Lagrangian is non-singular. See Simon and Blume
section 19.4 for a more detailed discussion.
