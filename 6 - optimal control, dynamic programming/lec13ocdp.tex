\section{Introduction} 

In the past few lectures we have focused on optimization problems of the form 
\[ \max_{x \in U} f(x) \text{ s.t. } h(x) = c \]
where $U \subseteq \R^n$. The variable that we are optimizing over,
$x$, is a finite dimensional vector. There are interesting
optimization problems in economics that involve an infinite
dimensional vector. 

\begin{example}\label{ex:consav}[Consumption-savings]
  An infinite horizon consumption-savings problem, 
  \[ \max_{\{c_t\}_{t=0}^\infty,\{s_t\}_{t=1}^\infty} \sum_{t=0}^\infty
  \beta^t u(c_t) \text{ s.t. } s_{t+1} = (1+r_t)(s_t - c_t), \]  
  involves maximizing over a countably infinite sequence of $c_t$ and
  $s_t$. The interpretation of this problem is that $u(c)$ is the
  per-period utility from consumption. $c_t$ is consumption at time
  $t$. $s_t$ is the savings you have at time $t$. $r_t$ is the return to
  savings at time $t$ in period $t+1$, and $\beta$ is the discount
  factor. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:contract}[Contracting with a continuum of
  types]
  On problem set 5, we studied a problem where a price discriminating
  monopolist was selling a good to two types of consumers. We could
  also imagine a similar situation where there is a continuous
  distribution of types. A consumer of type $\theta$ gets $0$ utility
  from not buying the good, and $\theta \nu(q) - T$ from buying $q$
  units of the good at cost $T$. Let the types be indexed by $\theta \in
  [\theta_l,\theta_h]$ and suppose the density of $\theta$ is $f_\theta$. The
  seller does not observe consumers' types. However, the seller can
  offer a menu of contracts $(q(\theta),T(\theta))$ such that type
  $\theta$ will choose contract $(q(\theta),T(\theta))$. The seller
  chooses the contracts to maximize profits subject to the requirement
  that each type chooses its contract.
  \begin{align}
    \max_{q(\theta),T(\theta)} & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} 
    \left[T(\theta) - cq(\theta)\right]
    f_\theta(\theta) d\theta \notag \\
    & \text{s.t.} \notag \\
    &\theta \nu\left(q(\theta)\right) - T(\theta) \geq 0  \forall
    \theta \label{pc} \\
    &\theta \nu\left(q(\theta)\right) - T(\theta) \geq
    \max_{\tilde{\theta}} \theta \nu\left(q(\tilde{\theta}) \right) -
    T(\tilde{\theta}) \forall \theta \label{ic} 
  \end{align}
  The first constraint (\ref{pc}) is referred to as the participation
  (or individual rationality)
  constraint. It says that each type $\theta$ must prefer buying the
  good to not. The second constraint  (\ref{ic}) is referred to as the
  incentive compatibility constraint. It says that type $\theta$ must
  prefer buying the $\theta$ contract instead of pretending to be
  some other type $\tilde{\theta}$. This approach to contracting with
  asymmetric information---that you can setup contracts such that each
  type chooses a contract designed for it---is called the revelation
  principle because the choice of contract makes the consumers reveal
  their types. Note that this setup does not just apply to price
  discriminating monopolists. There are many other applications. For
  example, if you consider a government that needs to raise a certain
  amount of revenue by taxing workers with heterogeneous productivity,
  then you end up with essentially the same problem. $\theta$ would be
  worker productivity. $q(\theta)$ is the labor supplied by type
  $\theta$, $\theta \nu(q(\theta))$ is the output of type $\theta$,
  and $T(\theta)$ is the tax. The government maximizes total output
  subject to a revenue constraint and the constraints above. 
  
  Anyway, in these sorts of problems, we need to take the maximum with
  respect to a function instead of a finite dimensional vector. 
\end{example}

Dynamic programming and optimal control are two approaches to solving
problems like the two examples above. In economics, dynamic
programming is slightly more often applied to discrete time problems
like example \ref{ex:consav} where we are maximizing over a sequence. Optimal
control is more commonly applied to continuous time problems like
\ref{ex:contract} where we are maximizing over functions. However,
dynamic programming can also be applied to continuous time problems
and optimal control can be applied to discrete time problems. 
Optimal control and dynamic programming 
problems are often treated quite differently than finite dimensional
optimization problems. Indeed there are specialized techniques for
solving optimal control and dynamic programming problems that do not
appear in finite dimensional optimization. However, the basic theory
of infinite dimensional and finite dimensional optimization are the
same. 
For infinite dimensional optimization problems, we can get the exact
same first and second order conditions as we did in the finite
dimensional case. To do this, we need to define derivatives in
abstract (in particular infinite dimensional) vector spaces. 

\subsection{References}
The last chapter of Chiang and Wainwright is a good practical
introduction to optimal control and Pontryagin's maximum principle.  A
classic reference for optimization on vector spaces is
\textit{Optimization by vector space methods} by Luenberger
(1969). \textit{Applied dynamic programming} by Bellman and Dreyfus
(1962) and \textit{Dynamic programming and the calculus of variations}
by Dreyfus (1965) provide a good introduction to the main idea of
dynamic programming, and are especially useful for contrasting the
dynamic programming and optimal control approaches. Stokey and Lucas
\textit{Recursive methods in economics dynamics} (1989) is the
standard economics reference for dynamic programming. Bertsekas's
\textit{Dynamic programming and stochastic control} is the standard
reference for dynamic programming with uncertainty. Acemoglu's
\textit{Introduction to Modern Economic Growth} includes two very nice
chapters on optimal control and dynamic programming.


\section{Differentiation in vector spaces}

Recall from earlier that there are many sets of functions that are
vector spaces. We talked a little bit about $\mathcal{L}^p$ spaces of
functions. The set of all continuous functions and the sets of all $k$
times continuously differentiable functions are also vector
spaces. One of these vector spaces of functions will be appropriate
for finding the solution to optimal control problems like
example \ref{ex:contract}. Exactly which vector space is a slightly
technical problem dependent question, so we will not worry about that
for now (and we may not worry about it at all). Similarly, there are
vector spaces of infinite sequences. Little $\ell^p$ is similar to big
$\mathcal{L}^p$, but with sequences instead of functions
\[ \ell^p = \{\{x_t\}_{t=1}^\infty:
\left(\sum_{t=1}^\infty |x_t|^p\right)^{1/p} < \infty\} \]
There are others as well. Again, the right choice of vector space
depends on the problem being considered, and we will not worry about
it too much. 

Recall our definition of the derivative for a function  $f:\R^n \to
\R^m$ was that $Df_x$ satisfies
\[ \lim_{\norm{h} \to 0} \frac{\norm{f(x+h) - f(x) - Df_x h}}{\norm{h}}
= 0 \]
 $\R^n$ and $\R^m$ are just two particular vector spaces. To write
down this definition of the derivative, we needed to have norms, so to
define derivatives in an abstract vector space, the space should have
a norm. The definition of a derivative also involves taking
limits. Recall that a complete normed vector space is a normed vector
space where all Cauchy sequences converge. This ensures that limits
are well behaved. We call complete normed vector spaces \textbf{Banach
  spaces}. Finally, $Df_x$ is an $m$ by $n$ matrix. It is a linear
transformation from $\R^n \to \R^m$.
\begin{definition}
  Let $V$ and $W$ be Banach spaces and $f:V \to W$. The
  \textbf{Fr\'{e}chet derivative} of $f$ at $x \in V$ is a continuous
  linear transformation from $V$ to $W$, denoted $Df_x$ such that
  \[ \lim_{\norm{h} \to 0} \frac{\norm{f(x+h) - f(x) - Df_x h
    }}{\norm{h}} = 0. \]
\end{definition}
Notice that this definition of the derivative is exactly the same as our
definition of the derivative for functions from $\R^n \to \R^m$. It is
called the Fr\'{e}chet derivative because there are other notions of
the derivative on abstract vector spaces. The G\^{a}teaux derivative
is a directional derivative. It is a weaker concept in that
Fr\'{e}chet differentiability implies G\^{a}teaux differentiability,
but not vice versa. There is also an intermediate type of derivative
called the Hadamard derivative, which is sometimes useful in
econometrics and statistics. We will only use Fr\'{e}chet derivatives
in this class, so henceforth, whenever we talk about the derivative of
a function on Banach spaces, we mean the Fr\'{e}chet derivative.  

Given two Banach spaces, $V$ and $W$, let $BL(V,W)$ denote the set of
all linear transformations from $V$ to $W$. The derivative of
 $f:V \to
W$ will be in $BL(V,W)$. We can show that $BL(V,W)$ is a vector space,
and we can define a norm on $BL(V,W)$ by 
\[ \norm{D}_{BL(V,W)} = \sup_{\norm{v}_V=1} \norm{D v}_{W} \]
where $\norm{\cdot}_V$ is the norm on $V$ and $\norm{\cdot}_W$ is the
norm on $W$. Moreover, we could show that $BL(V,W)$ is complete. Thus,
$BL(V,W)$ is also a Banach space. Viewed as function of $x$, $Df_x$ is
a function from $V$ to $BL(V,W)$. As we just said, there are both
Banach spaces, so can differentiate $Df_x$ with respect to $x$. In 
this way, we can define the second and higher derivatives of $f:V \to
W$. 

With this definition of the derivative, almost everything that we
proved in lecture 8 for functions from $\R^n \to \R^m$ also holds
functions on Banach spaces. In particular, Taylor's theorem, the
implicit function theorem, and the inverse function theorem
hold. The proofs of these theorems on Banach spaces are essential the
same as in lecture 8, so we will not go over them. The mean value
theorem is slightly more delicate. It still holds for functions $f:V
\to \R^m$, 
but not when the target space of $f$ is infinite
dimensional. If you find this interesting, you may want to go through
the proofs of all these claims, but it is not necessary to do so.

\section{Optimization in vector spaces}

In the previous section we saw that differentiation for functions on
Banach spaces is the same as for functions on finite dimensional
vector spaces. All of our proofs of first and second order conditions
only relied on Taylor expansions and some properties of linear
transformations. Taylor expansions and linear transformations are the
same on Banach spaces as on finite dimensional vector spaces, so our
results for optimization will still hold. Let's just state for the
first order condition for equality constraints. The other results are
similar, but stating them gets to be slightly cumbersome.
\begin{theorem}[First order condition for maximization with equality
  constraints] \label{thm:econv} Let $f:U \to \R$ and $h:U \to W$ be
  continuously differentiable on $U \subseteq V$, where 
  $V$ and $W$ are Banach spaces.  Suppose $x^* \in
  \mathrm{interior}(U)$ is a 
  local maximizer of $f$ on $U$ subject to
  $h(x) = 0$. Suppose that $Dh_{x^*}:V \to W$ is onto. 
. Then, there exists
  $\mu^* \in BL(W,\R)$ such that for
  \[ L(x,\mu) = f(x) - \mu h(x). \]
  we have
  \begin{align*}
     D_xL(x^*,\mu^*) = & Df_{x*} - \mu^* Dh_{x^*} = 0_{BL(V,\R)} \\
     D_\mu L(x^*,\mu^*) = & h(x^*) = 0_{W}
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
There are a few differences compared to the finite dimensional case
that are worth commenting on. First, in the finite dimensional case,
we had $h:U \to \R^m$, and the condition that $\rank Dh_{x^*} =
m$. This is the same as 
saying that the $Dh_{x^*}:\R^n \to \R^m$ is
onto. Rank is not well-defined in infinite dimension, so we now state
this condition as $Dh_{x^*}$ being onto instead of being rank
$m$. 

Secondly, previously $\mu \in \R^m$, and the Lagrangian was 
\[ L(x,\mu) = f(x) - \mu^T h(x). \] Viewed as a $1$ by $m$ matrix,
$\mu^T$ is a linear transformation from $\R^m$ to $\R$. Thus, in the
abstract case, we just say $\mu \in BL(W,\R)$, which as when we defined
transposes, is called the dual space of $W$ and is denoted $W^\ast$.

Finally, we have subscripted the zeroes in the first order condition
with $BL(V,\R)$ and $W$ to emphasize that the first equation is for
linear transformations from $V$ to $\R$, and the second equation is in
$W$. $Df_{x*}$ has been defined as a linear transformation from $V$ to
$\R$. $Dh_{x*}$ goes from $V$ to $W$. $\mu$ goes from $W$ to $\R$, so
$\mu$ composed with $Dh_{x*}$, which we just denoted by $\mu Dh_{x*}$
is a linear transformation from $V$ to $\R$.

\section{Optimal control}


Optimal control is just one example of optimization in a vector
space. 

\subsection{Continous time optimal control}
The classic continuous time optimal control problem has the
following form: 
\begin{align*}
  \max_{x(t),y(t)} & \int_0^T F(x(t),y(t),t) dt \\
  & \text{ s.t.} \\
  & \frac{d y}{dt} = g(x(t),y(t),t) \forall t \in [0,T] \\ 
  & y(0) = y_0
\end{align*}
$x$ is called a control variable, and $y$ is called a state
variable. The choice of $x$ controls the evolution of $y$ through the
first constraint.

In terms of our notation for optimization in vector spaces, the space
being maximized over, $V$ is pairs of functions $(x(t),y(t))$ from
$[0,T]$ to $\R$. The objective function is 
\[ f(x,y) = \int_0^T F(x(t),y(t),t) dt. \]
It is a mapping from $V$ to $\R$. The constraint, $h(x,y)$ is a
function from $V$ to a space of functions from $[0,T]$ to $\R$. As
above, we will call that space $W$, so $h:V \to W$ is 
\[ h(x,y)(t) = \frac{dy}{dt}(t) - g(x(t),y(t),t). \]
Let's apply theorem \ref{thm:econv}, and write out the first order
condition. The multiplier, $\mu$ is a linear transformation from $W$
to $\R$. There is also the constraint that $y_0 = y(0)$. Let $\mu_0$
be the multiplier on that constraint.
The Lagrangian, $L(x,y,\mu,\mu_0)$ is a map from $V \times BL(W,\R)
\times \R$
to $\R$ given by
\[ L(x,y,\mu,\mu_0) = \int_0^T F(x(t),y(t),t) dt  -
\mu\left(\frac{dy}{dt} - g(x,y,\cdot) \right) - \mu_0(y(0) - y_0). \]
I wrote $\frac{dy}{dt} - g(x,y,\cdot)$ to emphasize that this is some
element of $W$, a function of $t$. $\mu$ takes this function of $t$
and returns a real number. Many such transformations can be written as
integrals. Let's assume that
\[ \mu(w) = \int_{0}^T w(t) \lambda(t) dt \]
for some function $\lambda$.  We can guarantee that this is true by
appropriately defining $V$ and $W$.\footnote{One sufficient condition
  is to make $W$ a Sobolev space that includes generalized
  functions. Sobolev 
  spaces that include generalized functions are Hilbert spaces, so it
  follows from the Riesz representation theorem that $\mu(w) =
  \iprod{w}{\lambda}$. However, we only briefly mentioned Hilbert
  spaces, and we haven't talked at all about Sobolev spaces,
  generalized functions, or the Riesz representation theorem, so this
  footnote is likely very confusing and should be ignored.}

The first order conditions are
\begin{align}
  [x]: && D_xf_{x^*,y^*} - \mu D_xh_{x^*,y^*} = & 0 \\
  [y]: && D_yf_{x^*,y^*} - \mu D_yh_{x^*,y^*} - \mu_0 = & 0 \\
  [\mu]: && h(x^*,y*) = & 0 
\end{align}
Let's work out exactly what each of these derivatives are. $D_xf$ is a
linear map from $V \to \R$. Elements of $V$ are pairs of functions from
$[0,T]$ to $\R$. If we consider a single function from $[0,T]$ to
$\R$, $v$, and look at 
\[ \frac{d}{d a} \left(f(x+a v,y) \right)|_{a=0} \],
we get the directional derivative of $f$ in direction $v$ at $x,y$. By
analogy with the finite dimensional case, when $f$ is differentiable,
all its directional derivatives exist, are equal, and 
\[ \frac{d}{d a} \left(f(x+a v,y) \right)|_{a=0}  = D_x f v. \]
So to describe $D_xf$ it is enough to look at the directional
derivatives of $f$. 
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d a} f(x+a v,y) = & \frac{d}{da}  \int_0^T F(x(t)+a
  v(t),y(t),t) dt \\
  = & \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) dt
\end{align*}
where we need $F$ to be continuously differentiable for 
all $t \in
[0,1]$ in a neighborhood of $(x(t),y(t),t)$ so that interchanging the
derivative and integral is allowed. Thus,
\[ D_x f_{x,y} v = \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t)
v(t) dt. \]
Notice that this expression is linear in $v$. Similarly,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d a} f(x,y+av) = & \frac{d}{da}  \int_0^T
  F(x(t),y(t)+av(t),t) dt 
   \\
  = & \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) dt   
\end{align*}
so 
\[ D_y f_{x,y}v  =  \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t)
v(t) dt. \]

Now we calculate the derivative of $h$. $h:V \to W$, so its derivative
is a linear map from $V$ to $W$. Here, $W$ is a function from $[0,T]$
to $\R$, so $D_x h$ takes functions from $[0,T] \to \R$ and maps them
to functions from $[0,T] \to \R$. Using the same reasoning as above,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d a} h(x+av,y)(t) = & \frac{d}{da}\left[
     \frac{dy}{dt}(t) - g(x(t)+av(t),y(t),t)\right] \\
   = & - \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) 
 \end{align*}
so
\[ D_xh(v)(t) = -\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t). \]
Next,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d a} h(x,y+av)(t) = & \frac{d}{da}\left[
     \frac{d(y+av)}{dt}(t) - g(x(t),y(t)+av(t),t)\right] \\
   = & \frac{d v}{dt}(t) - \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) 
 \end{align*}
so 
\[ D_yh(v)(t) = \frac{d v}{dt}(t) - \frac{\partial g}{\partial
  y}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t). \]
Finally, as we assumed above, it can be shown that $\mu(w) = \int_0^T
w(t) \lambda(t) dt$ for some function $\lambda$. 

Combining all these facts, we can write the first order conditions for
$x$ and $y$ as 
\begin{align*}
  [x]:&& 0 = & \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) dt -
  \int_0^T -\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) \lambda(t)
  dt \\ 
  && = & \int_0^T v(t) \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) +
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) \lambda(t)\right) dt \\
  [y]:&& 0 = & \int_0^T \frac{\partial F}{\partial
    y}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t) dt - 
  \int_0^T \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}(t) -\frac{\partial
      g}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t) v(t)\right) \lambda(t)  dt  - \mu_0v(0)\\
  && = & \int_0^T v(t) \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial
      y}(x(t),y(t),t) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t)
    \lambda(t)  \right)dt - \int_0^T \frac{dv}{dt}(t)\lambda(t)
  dt  - \mu_0v(0)\\
  && = & \int_0^T v(t) \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial
      y}(x(t),y(t),t) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t)
    \lambda(t)  \right)dt + \int_0^T \frac{d\lambda}{dt}(t)v(t)dt -
  \\ 
  &&  & - \lambda(T)v(T) + \lambda(0)v(0)  - \mu_0v(0).
\end{align*}
The last line comes from integration by parts. These equations must be
zero for all $v \in V$. This can be true for all $v$ only if the
integrands are zero everywhere.  That is if
\begin{align*}
  [x]:&& 0 = &\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) +
  \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x(t),y(t),t) \lambda(t) \\
  [y]:&& -\frac{d\lambda}{dt}(t) = & \frac{\partial F}{\partial
    y}(x(t),y(t),t) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(x(t),y(t),t)
  v(t) \lambda(t) \\
  [\mu]:&& \frac{dy}{dt} = & g(x(t),y(t),t) 
\end{align*}
and $\lambda(T) = 0$ and $\mu_0 = \lambda(0)$. These are the usual
conditions that you get from using the Hamiltonian, which you may have
seen before. The function $\lambda(t)$ is called the \textbf{costate}
variable. The following theorem summarizes this result.
\begin{theorem}[Pontryagin's maximum principle]\label{thm:optcon}
  Consider 
  \begin{align}
    \max_{x,y \in U \subseteq X \times Y} & \int_0^T F(x(t),y(t),t) dt \notag \\
    & \text{ s.t.} \\
    &  \frac{d y}{dt} = g(x(t),y(t),t) \forall t \in
    [0,T] \label{e:maxp} \\ 
    & y(0) = y_0. \notag
  \end{align}
  where $X$ and $Y$ are some Banach spaces of differentiable 
  functions from $[0,T]$ to $\R$, and $F,g:\R^2 \times [0,T] \to \R$ are
  continuously differentiable. Define the Hamiltonian as 
  \[ H(x,y,\lambda,t) = F(x(t),y(t),t) + \lambda(t) g(x(t),y(t),t). \]
  If $x^*$ and $y^*$ are a local constrained maximum of
  (\ref{e:maxp}) in the interior of $U$, then there exists
  $\lambda^*(t)$ such that

    \\
    [y]: && -\frac{d\lambda}{dt}(t) = & \frac{\partial H}{\partial y}(x^*,y^*,\lambda^*,t) \\
    [\lambda]: && \frac{dy}{dt}(t) = & \frac{\partial H}{\partial
      \lambda}(x^*,y^*,\lambda^*,t)
  \end{align*}\footnote{The condition for $x$ is often stated somewhat
    more generally as
    \[ H(x^*,y^*,\lambda^*,t) = \max_x H(x,y^*,\lambda^*,t). \]

\subsection{Application: optimal contracting with a continuum of
  types} 
Let's solve example \ref{ex:contract}. 
\begin{align}
  \max_{q(\theta),T(\theta)} & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} 
  \left[T(\theta) - cq(\theta)\right]
  f_\theta(\theta) d\theta \notag \\
  & \text{s.t.} \notag \\
  &\theta \nu\left(q(\theta)\right) - T(\theta) \geq 0  \forall
  \theta \label{pc2} \\
  &\theta \nu\left(q(\theta)\right) - T(\theta) \geq
  \max_{\tilde{\theta}} \theta \nu\left(q(\tilde{\theta}) \right) -
  T(\tilde{\theta}) \forall \theta \label{ic2} 
\end{align}
First, notice that if the participation constraint (\ref{pc2}) holds for type
$\theta_l$, and (\ref{ic2}) holds for $\theta$, then the participation
constraint must also hold for $\theta$. 

We can show that the incentive compatibility constraint (\ref{ic2}) is
equivalent to the following local incentive 
compatibility constraint and monotonicity constraint.
\begin{align}
  \theta \nu'(q(\theta))q'(\theta) - T'(\theta) = & 0 \label{lic} \\
  \frac{dq(\theta)}{d\theta} \geq & 0 \label{mon}
\end{align}
Consider the incentive compatibility constraint
(\ref{ic2}). The first order condition for the maximization is
\[ \theta \nu'(q(\tilde{\theta})) q'(\tilde{\theta}) =
T'(\tilde{\theta}). \]
This is the same as the local incentive compatibility constraint with
$\theta = \tilde{\theta}$.

The second order condition for (\ref{ic2}) is 
\[ \theta \nu''(q(\tilde{\theta}))q'(\tilde{\theta})^2 +
\tilde{\theta} \nu'(q(\tilde{\theta})) q''(\tilde{\theta}) -
T''(\tilde{\theta}) \leq 0 \]   
On the other hand if we differentiate the local incentive
compatibility constraint we get 
\begin{align*}
  \nu'(q(\theta))q'(\theta) + \theta \nu''(q(\theta)) q'(\theta)^2 + \theta
  \nu'(q(\theta)) q''(\theta) - T''(\theta) = & 0 \\
  \theta \nu''(q(\theta)) q'(\theta)^2 + \theta
  \nu'(q(\theta)) q''(\theta) - T''(\theta) = & -\nu'(q(\theta))q'(\theta)  
\end{align*}
We assume that $\nu'>0$, and the monotonicity constraint says that
$q'\geq 0$. Hence, this equation implies the second order
condition. Therefore, we have shown that the local incentive
compatibility constraint and monotonicity constraint are equivalent
incentive compatibility constraint.

Now, we can write the seller's problem as
\begin{align}
  \max_{q(\theta),T(\theta)} & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} 
  \left[T(\theta) - cq(\theta)\right]
  f_\theta(\theta) d\theta \notag \\
  & \text{s.t.} \notag \\
  &\theta_l \nu\left(q(\theta_l)\right) - T(\theta_l) \geq 0
  \label{pcl} \\
  & \theta \nu'(q(\theta))q'(\theta) - T'(\theta) =  0 \label{lic2} \\
  & \frac{dq(\theta)}{d\theta} \geq  0 \label{mon2}
\end{align}
The first order condition for $T$ is for any $x:[\theta_l,\theta_h] \to \R$, 
\begin{align*}
  0 = &\int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} x(\theta) f_\theta(\theta)
  d\theta - \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} \mu(\theta)
  \frac{dx}{d\theta}(\theta) d\theta + \mu_0 x(\theta_l)  \\
  0 = & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} x(\theta)\left( f_\theta(\theta) +
    \frac{d\mu}{d \theta}(\theta)\right) - \mu(\theta_h)x(\theta_h) +
  \mu(\theta_l)x(\theta_l) + \mu_0 x(\theta_l).
\end{align*}
From this we see that $\mu'(\theta) = -f_\theta(\theta)$,
$\mu(\theta_l) = -\mu_0$, and $\mu(\theta_h) = 0$. Given $\mu'$ and
$\mu(\theta_h)$, it must be that
\begin{align*}
  \mu(\theta) = & \int_{\theta_h}^\theta -f_\theta(\hat{\theta}) d\hat{\theta} \\
  = & 1 - \int_{\theta_l}^\theta f_{\theta}(\hat{\theta})d\hat{\theta}
  \\
  = & 1 - F_\theta(\theta) 
\end{align*}
where $F_\theta$ is the cdf of $f_\theta$. 
The first order condition for $q$ is
\begin{align*}
  0 = & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} c x(\theta) f_\theta(\theta)
  d\theta - \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} \mu(\theta)
  \left( \theta \nu''(q(\theta))q'(\theta) x(\theta) + \theta
    \nu'(q(\theta)) x'(\theta) \right)d\theta - \\
  & - \mu_0 \theta_l
  \nu'(q(\theta_l))x'(\theta_l) - \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h}
  \lambda(\theta) x'(\theta) d\theta \\
  0 = & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} x(\theta)\left( c f_\theta(\theta)
    - \mu(\theta) \left( \theta \nu''(q(\theta))q'(\theta) x(\theta) -
      \nu'(q(\theta)) - \theta \nu''(q(\theta))q'(\theta) \right) \right)
  d\theta + \\
  & + \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} 
  \mu'(\theta) \theta \nu'(\theta) d\theta 
  - \mu(\theta_h)\theta_h \nu'(q(\theta_h))x(\theta_h) +
  \mu(\theta_l)\theta_l \nu'(q(\theta_l))x(\theta_l) - \\
  & - \mu_0 \theta_l \nu'(q(\theta_l))x'(\theta_l) 
  - \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} \lambda(\theta) x'(\theta) d\theta \\
  0 = & \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} x(\theta)\left( c f_\theta(\theta)
    + \mu(\theta) \nu'(q(\theta)) + 
    \mu'(\theta) \theta \nu'(\theta)\right) d\theta  - \\
    & - \mu(\theta_h)\theta_h \nu'(q(\theta_h))x(\theta_h) +
    \mu(\theta_l)\theta_l \nu'(q(\theta_l))x(\theta_l) - \\
    & - \mu_0 \theta_l \nu'(q(\theta_l))x'(\theta_l) 
    - \int_{\theta_l}^{\theta_h} \lambda(\theta) x'(\theta) d\theta 
\end{align*}
If we assume that the monotonicy constraint does not bind, so
$\lambda(\theta) = 0$, we see that
\begin{align*}
  0 = &c f_\theta(\theta) + \mu(\theta) \nu'(q(\theta)) + \mu'(\theta)
   \theta \nu'(q(\theta))  \\
   0 = & cf_\theta(\theta) + (1-F_\theta(\theta)) \nu'(q(\theta)) -
   f_{\theta}(\theta) \theta \nu'(q(\theta)) \\
   \theta \nu'(q(\theta)) = & c +
   \frac{1-F_\theta(\theta)}{f_\theta(\theta)} \nu'(q(\theta)) \\
   \left(\theta - \frac{1-F_\theta(\theta)}{f_\theta(\theta)}
   \right)\nu'(q(\theta)) = & c 
 \end{align*}
You may recall from problem set 5 that with symmetric information,
$\theta \nu'(q(\theta)) = c$. Since $\nu'$ is decreasing in $q$, this
implies that $q(\theta)$ is less than what it would be in the first
best symmetric information case for all $\theta < \theta_h$. The
highest type, $\theta_h$ gets the optimal level of consumption since
$F_\theta(\theta_h) = 1$. 
 
\subsection{Discrete time optimal control}
We can also consider discrete time optimal control problems of the
form
\begin{align*}
  \max_{x_t,y_y} & \sum_{t=0}^\infty F(x_t,y_t,t) \\
  & \text{ s.t. } \\
  & y_{t+1} - y_t = g(x_t,y_t,t) 
\end{align*}
with $y_0$ given. For simplicity, we will assume $x_t \in \R$ and $y_t \in
\R$, but $x_t$ and $y_t$ could be elements of any normed vector
spaces. Example \ref{ex:consav} has this form with $x_t = c_t$, $y_t =
s_t$, 
$F(x_t,y_t,t) = \beta^t u(c_t)$, and 
$g(x_t,y_t,t) = r_t s_t -(1+r_t)c_t$. 
We can apply theorem \ref{thm:econv} to this problem. Here we are
maximizing over a pair of infinite sequences,
$\{x_t,y_t\}_{t=0}^\infty \in V$, where $V$ is a Banach space of such
sequences.\footnote{As in the continuous time case, we will be somewhat vague
about this space because its details depends on the problem at
hand. For example, it would often be appropriate to use the space of
all bounded sequences, $\ell^\infty =\{x_t,y_t: x_t \leq M, y_t \leq M
\forall t \text{ for some } M <\infty \}$. Other times it would be
appropriate to use some other space. For example, in \ref{ex:consav}
it might make sense to consider any sequence such that $\sum_{t=0}^\infty
\beta^t u(c_t)$ is finite, or if $r_t=r$ is fixed, it might make sense
to look at any sequence such that $\sum_{t=0}^\infty
\frac{c_t}{(1+r)^t}$ is finite. We will not worry about these
details.} The constraint can be written as 
\[ h(x,y)_t =  y_{t+1} - y_t - g(x_t,y_t,t).  \]
$h$ takes the pair of infinite sequences, $x,y \in V$ and returns
another infinite sequence, which is in some Banach space $W$. The
multiplier, $\mu$ is a map from $W$ to $\R$. If $W$ were finite
dimension, we would have $\mu(w) = \mu^T w = \sum_{i=}^m \mu_m
w_m$. It turns out that for infinite sequences, $\mu$, we could show
that $\mu$ must have the same form, so $\mu(w) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty
\mu_t w_t$. Thus, we can write the Lagrangian as
\[ L(x,y,\mu) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty \left(F(x_t,y_t,t) -
  \mu_t(y_{t+1}-y_t - g(x_t,y_t,t) \right). \]
Note that the derivative of $L$ with respect to $x$ is a linear
transformation from $V$ to $\R$. If we consider $v \in V$ and look at
the directional derivative in direction $v$, like we did in the
continuous case, we see that
\[ D_xL(v) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial
    x}(x_t,y_t,t)v_t  + \mu_t \frac{\partial g}{\partial
    x}(x_t,y_t,t)v_t\right) = 0 \]
This must hold for all $v_t$, so the summand must be zero for each
$t$. Applying similar reasoning to the first order conditions for $y$
and $\mu$, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
  [x]:&& \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x_t,y_t,t)  + \mu_t \frac{\partial
    g}{\partial x}(x_t,y_t,t) = &  0 \\
  [y]: && \mu_{t-1}-\mu_t = \frac{\partial F}{\partial
    y}(x_t,y_t,t)  + \mu_t \frac{\partial 
    g}{\partial y}(x_t,y_t,t) = &  0 \\
  [mu]:&& y_{t+1} - y_t = & g(x_t,y_t,t) 
\end{align*}
and $y_0 = 0$
Notice the similarity to theorem \ref{thm:optcon}. The only difference 
is that these equations involve $\mu_{t} - \mu_{t-1}$ instead of
$\frac{d\lambda}{dt}$ and $y_{t+1}-y_t$ instead of $\frac{dy}{dt}$. 

\section{Dynamic programming}

For problems like examples \ref{ex:consav} and \ref{ex:contract},
optimal control focuses on characterizing $x^*$ through the first
order conditions (given $x^*$, $y^*$ is easily determined through the
constraint). That is, optimal control focus on characterizing the maximizer. An
alternative approach is to focus on the value of the maximized
function. This value will depend on the entire problem, but in
particular it depends on the initial condition $y_0$. Thus, we can
think of the value as function of the initial state. Dynamic
programming focuses on characterizing the value function.  

The basic idea of dynamic programming can be illustrated in a familiar
finite dimensional optimization problem. Consider a finite horizon
discrete time consumption savings choice. 
\[ \max_{c_t,s_t} \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t) \text{ s.t. } s_{t+1} =
(1+r_t) (s_t - c_t) \]
with $s_0$ given, and the constraint that $s_{T+1} = 0$. We could just write down the first order conditions
and try to solve them for $c_t$. However, if $T$ is large, this might
be very difficult. We can divide this $T$ dimensional problem to a
series of smaller ones by first thinking about what happens at time
$T$. At time $T$ we have some savings $s_T$ and want to choose $c_T$
to solve
\[ \max_{c_T} u(c_T) \text{ s.t. } s_{T+1} = (1+r_T)(s_T -c_T) = 0 \]
As long as $u$ is increasing, it must be that $c_T^*(s_T) = s_T$. If
we define the value of savings at time $T$ as
\[ V_T(s) = u(s), \]
then at time $T-1$ given $s_{T-1}$, we can choose $c_{T-1}$ to solve
\[ \max_{c_{T-1},s'} u(c_{T-1}) + \beta V_T(s') \text{ s.t.} s' =
  (1+r_{T-1})(c_{T-1}-s_{T-1}). \]
This is relatively simple maximization problem with just two
variables, so we can solve it without too much difficulty. Repeating
in this way, for each $t$ we can define the value of savings at time
$t$ as
\begin{align} 
  V_t(s) = \max_{c_t,s'} u(c_{t}) + \beta V_{t+1}(s') \text{ s.t.} s' =
  (1+r_{t})(c_{t}-s). \label{e:bell}
\end{align}
This approach to sequential optimization was first proposed by Richard
Bellman, so (\ref{e:bell}) is called a Bellman equation. Notice that
if $(c_t^*(s_t),s_{t+1}^*(s_t)$ is a maximizer of (\ref{e:bell}) for
each $t$, then 
the sequence of $c_0^*(s_0),s_1^*(s_0), c_1^*(s_1), ..., c_T^*$ must
be a maximizer of the original problem. Bellman called this
observation the \textbf{principle of optimality}. He described it as,
``An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state
and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an
optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first
decision.'' (Bellman and Dreyfus 1962). 

In finite horizon problems, it easy to see that the
Bellman equations will exist. However, if we have an infinite horizon
problem, 
\[ \max_{c_t,s_t} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t) \text{ s.t. } s_{t+1} =
(1+r_t) (s_t - c_t) \]
then we cannot start from the last period to define the value
function. However, if the problem is stationary, that is if the
problem at time $t$ and at time $t+1$ are the same, then it seems
reasonable to think that the value function would not depend on $t$
and we could just write 
\[ V(s) = \max_{c,s'} u(c) + \beta V(s') \text{ s.t. } s' =
(1+r)(s-c). \]
Stokey and Lucas (1989) provide a fairly comprehensive analysis of
various conditions when this is possible. We will just look at one
case. 

Consider a problem that is slightly more general than the consumption
savings choice problem with fixed interest rate.
\begin{align*}
  \max_{c_t,s_t} & \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t,s_t) \\
  & s_{t+1} = g(c_t,s_t),
\end{align*}
where $c \in \R$, $s \in \R$, $0<\beta<1$, and $u,g:\R^2 \to \R$.
We want to show that the value function exists. Suppose we start with
some guess at the value function $v_0:\R\to \R$. Then we refine that guess by
setting 
\[ v_1(s) = \max_{c,s'} u(c,s) + \beta v_0(s') \text{ s.t. }
s'=g(c,s) \]
We could do this repeatedly. That is, if we let $T$ be the functional
defined by this equation,
\[ T(v)(s) = \max_{c,s'} u(c,s) + \beta v_0(s') \text{ s.t. }
s'=g(c,s), \]
we can construct a sequence with $v_{i+1} = T(v_i)$. Recall from
lecture 9 that $T$ is a contraction mapping if 
\[ \norm{T(v) - T(v')} \leq c \norm{v-v'} \]
for some $c<1$ and all $v,v'$. We proved that contraction mappings
have unique fixed points.\footnote{We did this for contractions on
  $\R^n$, but our proof works for any complete vector space.} Thus, if
we can show that $T$ is a contraction mapping, then $v_i \to V$, where
$V$ is the value function that satisfies the Bellman equation, like we
want. 

Suppose $u$ is bounded, $u(c,s) \leq M$ for all $c$ and $s$. Then 
\[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t,s_t)  \leq \frac{M}{1-\beta}. \]
Therefore, we should only look at possible value functions with $v(s)
\leq \frac{M}{1-\beta}$ for all $s$. To show that $T$ is a
contraction, we must define the space that $v$ lies in and its
norm. Given the boundedness of $v$, it is natural to look at
$\mathcal{L}^\infty(\R)$, the space of all bounded real-valued function
with norm $\norm{v} = \sup_{x \in \R} |v(x)|$. Consider
\begin{align*}
  T(v_0)(s)-T(v_1)(s) =  \left(u(c_0,s) + \beta v_0(s_0')  \right) -
  \left(u(c_1,s) + \beta v_1(s_1')  \right)
\end{align*} 
where $c_i,s_i'$ is the maximizer to 
\begin{align*}
  \max_{c_i,s_i'} u(c_i,s) + \beta v_i(s_i') \text{ s.t. }
  s_i'=g(c_i,s).
\end{align*}
We should assume something that ensures $c$ and $s'$ exist. Assuming
$c',s$ lie in a compact set would be sufficient. Notice that
\[ T v_0 (s) = u(c_0,s) + \beta v_0(s_0')  \geq u(c_1,s) + \beta
v_0(s_1'). \]
Therefore,
\[ T(v_0)(s) - T(v_1)(s) \geq \beta (v_0(s_1') - v_1(s_1'). \]
Similarly,
\[ T(v_0)(s)-T(v_1)(s) \leq \beta (v_0(s_0') - v_1(s_0'). \]
It follows that
\begin{align*}
  \norm{T(v_0)-T(v_1)} = & \sup_{s} \left\vert T(v_0)(s)-T(v_1)(s) \right\vert \\
  \leq & \sup_s \left\vert \beta(v_0(s) -v_1(s)) \right\vert = \beta
  \norm{v_0 - v_1}.
\end{align*}
Hence, $T$ is a contraction and has a unique fixed point $V$. 

\subsection{Application: Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search model}

The standard neo-classical and neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models do
not have any involuntary unemployment. If we include a labor-leisure
choice, these models may not have everyone working (or at least not
working full-time), but everyone who does not work does so
voluntarily. We need to add something to the model if we want there to
be involuntary unemployment. The standard way of modeling
involuntary unemployment is through a search model. We will go through
a simple version of a search model. It is often called a
Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search model because those three people
were the first to propose it. 

There is a continuum of identical workers with total measure
one. There is also a continuum of identical firms. Time is
discrete. Workers can be either unemployed or employed. Firms can
either employ one worker, post a vacancy, or do nothing. There is free
entry. Posting a vacancy costs $k$. When a firm has a worker, they
produce output $y$. Matches are dissolved with exogenous probability
$s$. Unemployed workers produce a benefit of $b$ each period. Workers'
utility is just the discounted sum of their consumption.

Let $u_t$ be the mass of unemployed workers at time $t$, and let $v_t$
be the mass of vacancies. That is,
\[ u_t = \int_{\text{all workers}} 1\{\text{worker $i$ unemployed}\} di \]
\[ v_t = \int_{\text{all firms}} 1\{\text{firm $j$ unemployed}\} dj. \]
There is some matching technology $m(u_t,v_t)$ such that the
probability that any given unemployment worker finds a vacancy at time
$t$ is $\frac{m(u_t,v_t)}{u_t}$. Similarly, the probability that any
given vacant firm finds a worker is $\frac{m(u_t,v_t)}{v_t}$. We will
assume that $m$ has constant returns to scale, so in particular,
\[ m(u_t,v_t) = u_t m(1,v_t/u_t) = v_t m(u_t/v_t,1) \]
We define labor market tightness as $\theta_t = \frac{v_t}{u_t}$. Then
we can write the unemployed worker's and vacant firm's matching
probabilities as 
\[ \frac{m(u_t,v_t)}{u_t} = m(1,v_t/u_t) = m(1,\theta_t) \equiv
\mu(\theta_t) \]
and 
\[ \frac{m(u_t,v_t)}{v_t} = \frac{m(1,v_t/u_t)u_t}{v_t} =
\frac{\mu(\theta_t)}{\theta_t}. \] 
To ensure that these are valid probabilities assume that $0 \leq \mu(\theta)
\leq \min\{1,\theta\}$. Also, we will assume that $\mu$ is twice
continuously differentiable with $\mu'>0$ and $\mu''<0$. 

\subsubsection{Social planner}

Suppose a social planner wants to maximize utility subject to the
matching and production technologies. 
\begin{align*}
  \max_{c_t,v_t,u_t} & \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \left( (1-u_t)c_t^e + u_t
    c_t^u\right) \\
  & \text{ s.t.} \\
  & c_t^e + c_t^u = u_t b + (1-u_t) y - k v_t \\
  & u_{t+1} = (1-\mu(v_t/u_t)) u_t + s (1-u_t) 
\end{align*}
Note that all that matters is total consumption, not $c_t^e$ and
$c_t^u$ separately. Therefore we can eliminate the first constraint, leaving
\begin{align*}
  \max_{v_t,u_t} & \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \left(u_t b + (1-u_t)
    y - k v_t\right) \\ 
  & u_{t+1} = (1-\mu(v_t/u_t)) u_t + s (1-u_t).
\end{align*}
Also, it is common to work with $\theta_t$ instead of $v_t$. Since
$v_t = u_t \theta_t$, we can write the problem as
\begin{align*}
  \max_{\theta_t,u_t} & \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \left(u_t b + (1-u_t)
    y - k \theta_t u_t\right) \\ 
  & u_{t+1} = (1-\mu(\theta_t)) u_t + s (1-u_t).
\end{align*}
The Bellman equation for this problem is
\begin{align*}
  V(u) = \max_{\theta,u'} & u b + (1-u) y - k \theta u + \beta V(u') \\
  & \text{ s.t. } u' = (1-\mu(\theta)) u + s(1-u)
\end{align*}
A common method for solving dynamic programming problems is to guess
the form of the solution and then verify. It is often the case that
$V(u)$ has the same form as the per-period payoff. Here, the
per-period payoff is linear in $u$, so a good guess is that 
\[ V(u) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u. \]
We plug this guess in for $V$, then use the first order condition for
the Bellman equation to find out what $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ must
be. If there are no $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ that make the first
order condition hold, then our guess was incorrect. If our guess was
correct, we will be able to uniquely solve for $\alpha_0$ and
$\alpha_1$. Substituting the guess we have
\begin{align*}
  \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u = \max_{\theta,u'} & u b + (1-u) y - k \theta
  u + \beta \left(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u' \right) \\ 
  & \text{ s.t. } u' = (1-\mu(\theta)) u + s(1-u)
\end{align*}
The first order conditions are
\begin{align*}
  0 = & -ku - \lambda \mu'(\theta) u \\
  0 = & \beta \alpha_1 - \lambda
\end{align*}
To solve for $\alpha_1$ note that by the envelope theorem,
\begin{align*} \alpha_1 = & b - y - k\theta + \beta
  \alpha_1\left(1-\mu(\theta) - s \right) \\ 
  \alpha_1 = & \frac{b - y - k\theta}{\beta\left(1-\mu(\theta) - s
    \right)} 
\end{align*}
From the first order condition,
\begin{align}
  \mu'(\theta^*) = & \frac{-k}{\beta \alpha_1 u} \notag \\
  \mu'(\theta^*) = & \frac{-k\left(1-\mu(\theta^*) - s \right)}{ \left(b-y-k
      \theta^* \right)} \label{e:hosiosSP}
\end{align}
In particular, $\theta^*$ does not depend on $u$. Therefore, ${u^*}'$ only
depends on $u$ through the constraint. Since the constraint is linear
in $u$, ${u^*}'$ will also be linear in $u$. Finally, the guess $V(u) =
\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u$ is linear in $u$, so $V({u^*}')$ will also be
linear in $u$. Therefore, our guess is verified. By itself, solving
the social planner problem is not very insightful. The one useful
thing is that we know that the efficient level of labor market
tightness satisfies (\ref{e:hosiosSP}). We can use this equation as a
benchmark to compare what happens under other conditions. 

\subsubsection{Competitive equilibrium} 

Due to the matching friction, wages cannot be determined by supply and
demand in the usual way. A worker cannot just go and find another job
at the prevailing wage. Likewise for a firm. Together, a matched
worker and firm are strictly better off than an unmatched worker and
firm. Matched workers and firms earn a surplus, and we need some way
of deciding how to divide this surplus. The typical way is through
Nash bargaining. If the total output of a match is $y$, the bargaining
power of the worker is $\eta$, the outside option of the worker is
$o_w$ and the outside option of the firm is $o_f$, then the Nash
bargained wage solve
\[ \max_w (w - o_w)^\eta (y-w - o_f)^{1-\eta}. \]
The first order condition is
\[ 0 = \eta (w - o_w)^{\eta-1} (y-w - o_f)^{1-\eta} - (1-\eta) (w -
o_w)^\eta (y-w - o_f)^{-\eta}. \]
Rearranging,
\[ \frac{\eta}{1-\eta} = \frac{ w - o_w} {y-w - o_f}. \]
The wage is such that benefit to the worker relative to the benefit to
the firm is equal to the ratio of their bargaining powers. 

To apply this result to our model, we must find the outside options of
the worker and firm. That is, we must find the value of being
unemployed and of being a vacant firm. Since there is free entry, the
value of being a vacant firm must be zero. For simplicity, let's focus
on the steady state when $\theta_t = \theta$ for all $t$. For workers,
let $v(w)$ denote the value of value of being employed given wage $w$
and $u(w)$ be the value of being unemployed. The Bellman equations for
these are
\begin{align*}
  v(w) = & w + \beta \left( (1-s) v(w) + s u(w) \right) \\
  u(w) = & b + \beta \left( \mu(\theta) v(w) + (1-\mu(\theta)) u(w)
  \right) 
\end{align*}
Similarly, if $j(w)$ is the value of a firm having a worker, and
$i(w)$ is the value of posting a vacancy, then must satisfy
\begin{align*}
  j(w) = & y - w + \beta (1-s)j(w) \\
  i(w) = & 0 = -k + \beta \frac{\mu(\theta)}{\theta} j(w)
\end{align*}
$i(w)$ is zero because of free entry, but we still wrote down its
Bellman equation since it will be useful later. 

Now, we are ready to find the equilibrium wage. The benefit to a
worker of getting wage $w$ is not just $w$, it is $v(w)$. Similarly,
the firm gets not $y-w$, but $j(w)$. The outside option of the firm is
$i(w) = 0$. The outside option is $u(w^e)$, where $w^e$ is the wage at
other firms (the equilibrium wage). The bargaining problem is then
\[ \max_w \left( v(w) - u(w^e) \right)^\eta j(w)^{1-\eta} \]
As above, the wage solution satisfies
\[ \frac{\eta}{1-\eta} = \frac{v(w) - u(w)}{j(w)} \]
Combining this equation and the Bellman equations, we can solve for
the wage and $\mu(\theta)$. The Bellman equation for $j(w)$ gives
\[ j(w) = \frac{y-w}{1-\beta(1-s)} \]
Combining with the Bellman equation of $i(w)$ we get
\begin{align*}
  k = & \beta \frac{\mu(\theta)}{\theta}  \frac{y-w}{1-\beta(1-s)} \\ 
  w = & y - k \frac{1-\beta(1-s)}{\beta \mu(\theta)} 
\end{align*}
... \\
Eventually we get the Hosios-Mortensen condition, that the competitive
equilibrium is efficient only if
\[1-\eta = \frac{\theta\mu'(\theta)} {\mu(\theta)}. \]
